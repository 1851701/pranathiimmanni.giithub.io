    <h1><center> This was my groups project, the idea was to create a snake and go to various coordinates by passing through apples. Each time the snake passes through an apple, it gets longer by 1 inch. To finish the game, you have to pass through all the apples and form the word snake. All of our ideas were listed under the form of the Pseudcode.

    <h1><center> This was my groups porject, the idea was to create a game where each person has to go across five lanes, without getting hit and going by any speed that you prefer. If you reach the big box at the top you get a point, but if you get hit by a car then you don't get any points and get back to the bottom to restart because you lost.

    <h1><center> This was my groups project, the idea was to create a dino Chrome's game so that a little dino can run over objects at its speed. We had some errors throughout the project, but the rest turned out pretty good.

    <h1><center> This was my groups project, the idea was to create a Mario game so that a person could go through different stages while avioding certain objects and jumping over certain objects. We also used a list of animations such as different clothings, volumes, and places.
