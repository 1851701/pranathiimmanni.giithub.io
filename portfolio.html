    <h1><center> This was my groups project, the idea was to create a snake and go to various coordinates by passing through apples. Each time the snake passes through an apple, it gets longer by 1 inch. To finish the game, you have to pass through all the apples and form the word snake. All of our ideas were listed under the form of the Pseudcode.
